  % If the number of wrong answers is equal to the total number of answers (NM == N) then the correct answer is "None of the above". In this case, the question is correct (1) if no wrong answer was checked (1 - NMC). 
  % Otherwise, each correct option is valued at 1 dividing by the total number of correct options (1/NB). The final score is given by the number of correct options selected minus the number of incorrect options selected (NBC*(1/NB) - NMC*(1/NB))
  formula= NM == N ? 1 - NMC : NBC*(1/NB) - NMC*(1/NB)
